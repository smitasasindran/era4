## Installation

### Method 1: Load Unpacked Extension (Recommended for Development)

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Method 2: Create Icons

Before installing, you'll need to create icon files:
- `icons/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use any image editor or download free icons from sites like:
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)


If you want to use the 'Export PDF' option, you may need to download these pdf-related libraries to your local folder, before 'Load unpacked' to chrome extension. Create a local directory, example: 
mkdir libs
curl -L -o libs/jspdf.umd.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspdf@2.5.1/dist/jspdf.umd.min.js
curl -L -o libs/jspdf.plugin.autotable.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jspdf-autotable@3.5.29/dist/jspdf.plugin.autotable.min.js

## How It Works

### Content Script (`content.js`)
- Runs on YouTube pages
- Detects video elements and extracts metadata
- Captures video frames for screenshots
- Retrieves transcript data
- Adds floating action buttons to the page

### Background Script (`background.js`)
- Handles keyboard shortcuts
- Manages communication between components
- Stores data in Chrome's local storage

### Popup Interface (`popup.html/popup.js`)
- Displays saved screenshots and bookmarks
- Provides management tools (view, delete, export)
- Shows keyboard shortcut information

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API:

- **Screenshots**: Base64-encoded PNG images with metadata
- **Bookmarks**: Timestamp, video info, and transcript context
- **No data is sent to external servers**

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Make sure you're on a YouTube video page
2. Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check the browser console for error messages

### Screenshots Not Working
1. Ensure the video is playing or paused (not loading)
2. Check that the video element is present on the page
3. Try refreshing the page and waiting for the video to load

### Transcripts Not Available
1. Not all YouTube videos have transcripts
2. The extension automatically tries to load available transcripts
3. If no transcript is available, it will show "No transcript available for this timestamp"

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working
1. Make sure you're on a YouTube page
2. Check that no other extensions are conflicting
3. Try the floating buttons as an alternative

## Privacy & Security

- **Local storage only**: All data is stored locally in your browser
- **No external requests**: The extension doesn't make any network requests
